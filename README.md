# pegasso-web
I developed this web as the first year project for markup languages in my web development degree. A high-end corporate website for "Pegasso". Built with semantic HTML5 and CSS3, following strict academic requirements. Developed with a focus on W3C standards and UI/UX performance. AI was used to produce media assets. Code in Spanish.
